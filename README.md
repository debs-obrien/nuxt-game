## Nuxt Game

This game was created for a live stream to show how to migrate an app from Vue to Nuxt. Questions and some svgs were changed but all the credit goes to Sarah Drasner for creating the original which you can learn how to do in her [workshop on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue-nuxt-apps) or check out here amazing [open source code](https://github.com/sdras/building-web-apps-with-vue).

Thanks Sarah.

Feel free to clone it and create your own fun game.
